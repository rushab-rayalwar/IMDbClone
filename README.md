# IMDbClone
A front-end project which fetches data from the OMDb api.
Features:
1. Suggestions: Suggestions for searching pop below the search bar as the user types in it. Clicking on a suggestion will switch the screen to 'movie-scree' showing the details of the clicked movie.
2. Favourites: User can mark a movie as 'favourite' which adds the movie to the favourite movies' list. The list is stored locally and thus, it can be retained when the browser is restarted.
3. Search Results: After searching for a movie name, the data is fetched from the OMDb api and is showcased.
4. Movie Page: When a movie from the search results or from the favourites list is clicked, the user is directed to the clicked movie's page. The page showcases the movie's details.
5. Transitions: When the user switches between the 'movie-page', 'favourites', 'search-results' screens, a fade-out and fade-in transition occurs which makes the switching appear smoother and visually appealing.
6. Navigation: Back button is present on the 'movie-page' and the 'favourites' screens which directs the user to the 'search-results' screen. To view 'favourites', user can click the favourites button in the header.
   To go to the 'movie-page', the user can simply click on the movie from either the search results or favourites.
7. Header-Styling: I have tried to make the header look exactly similar to the original IMDb website.
